Engineer diary - Wilma Eriksson



**Tools**

I’ve learnt new tools to use when coding which make teamworks easier. 

Github / Codeberg 

Is a good tool to use when working together with a project. With Github you can share source code with the classmate next to you or your coworkers in Japan.

commands like: git pull, git push, git status, git fetch
 
Docker

You can use a tool like docker to create a container in a computer. The container can be used to run programs. For example if you download a sketchy file or a program, you can use a container to run the program. Because then the program or file  will not affect the reel computer .

I have also learnt that there are different programming languages, for example Java, Javascript and C++. 


**the Teamwork**

The groups teamwork was alright. Our communication could have been better, because for me it was unclear who was supposed to do what. In the end almost the whole project was made by one person. 



**My contribution**

My contribution could have been better. Since it was unclear to me who was doing what, I felt overwhelmed by everything. I find it difficult to manage my time because I have difficulty anticipating how long something will take. In the beginning I thought I had all the time in the world but now the deadline is on friday. 



**Conclusion**

My conclusion is that I need to start planning my weeks better. I’ll also use the support I'm allowed to have to make me “see” better. 


What I will take with me to future group projects is that I will plan my time better and do a better job at sharing the workload.
