# This is an assignment for the basic software development course for group number 14.
The assignment requires setting up a hypothetical webb-browser for the company, serving burger ordering and management. 
The contents of the files in the project are as follows:
## 1. Engineer diary: 
- Individuals in the group will update the problems encountered, solutions implemented, Github commands learned during the project implementation.
## 2. Planning: 
- Is the result of group meetings, in which the plans to be implemented, being implemented and implemented are recorded.
## 3. Reflections: 
- Summarizes the programming diary.
## 4. Containers: 
- Our project consists of three main folders.
  + The BurgerOrderer folder contains everything needed for placing burger orders.
  + All orders are stored in a database located in the MenuStore folder, which we built using DB Browser for SQLite.
  + In the KitchenView folder, you can access and download order information directly from the database.
### 5. .gitignore 
- It is where we specify items that we donâ€™t need to track or use in our repository, but prefer to exclude rather than delete. It helps keep unnecessary files out of version control while still keeping them locally.
### 6. License: MIT license
